        <h4> Tiago </h4>
        <p>The personal goals that I want to achieve are:Continue to develop my ability to constantly learn in the area of computer science through courses, training and challenging projects;
To develop leadership and communication skills to lead successful team projects in computer science;To be a dedicated and responsible professional, committed to the quality of 
work and the results achieved;To develop myself as a person and as a professional, always open to new experiences and opportunities.In this project I would like to work as a Requirements Analyst because I think it is an 
important part of the development of a project and it is the role in which I feel more comfortable and have more knowledge to work in. I would like to work as a Systems 
Architect or Project Manager because I have expertise in that area and because of my leadership skills, respectively.I would not like to work as a Programmer or Tester because those are two roles that 
require a lot of programming knowledge, which is not my strong suit. So if I were a programmer, I would want to program the frontend, since I already worked on a small frontend project with mostly HTML and CSS.</p>
